"""Mandy, the HR manager, has implemented a new system to automate the calculation of employee bonuses and taxes based on tenure. Employees with more than 5 years of service receive a bonus, which is a percentage of their annual salary. He also calculates the tax on the total income, which includes the salary and bonus, and finally, he computes the net salary after tax.



Formula:

net bonus = (bonus percentage / 100) * Salary

tax amount = (tax percentage / 100) * (salary + net bonus)

net salary = salary + net bonus - tax amount

Input format :
The first line of input consists of a float S, representing the annual salary of the employee.

The second line consists of an integer N, representing the number of years the employee has been with the company.

The third line consists of a float B, representing the bonus percentage.

The fourth line consists of a float T, representing the tax percentage.

Output format :
The first line of output displays "You have earned a bonus of X units." if eligible, otherwise "Sorry, you are not eligible for a bonus." where X is the bonus amount rounded to two decimal places.

The second line displays "Tax Amount: Y units", where Y is the tax amount.

The third line displays "Net Salary: Z units", where Z is the net salary after tax.
